{QUESTION: This is a question.}
{ANSWER: The word "bean" and its Germanic cognates (e.g. German Bohne) have existed in common
 use in West Germanic languages since before the 12th century,[1] referring to broad 
 beans and other pod-borne seeds. This was long before the New World genus Phaseolus 
 was known in Europe. After Columbian-era contact between Europe and the Americas, 
 use of the word was extended to pod-borne seeds of Phaseolus, such as the common 
 bean and the runner bean, and the related genus Vigna. The term has long been applied
 generally to many other seeds of similar form,[1][2] such as Old World soybeans,
 peas, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), other vetches, and lupins, and even to those with
 slighter resemblances, such as coffee beans, vanilla beans, castor beans, and cocoa beans.
 Thus the term "bean" in general usage can mean a host of different species.[3]}
