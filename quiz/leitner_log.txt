and remove another list of items from the list. Vectors an list are almost the same thing. A set 
is a list with no duplicates. Can be array or LinkedList based.

placed on top. This is also called LIFO or last in first out. Call stack is common application.
When you get an exception the error message wiil list a call stack trace. Called unwiding the
stack. Stack overflow is where you fill the stack up so much you run out of memory for it.

list builds and as your software gets time it pulls characters that first to come into the queue.
A priority queue is like the system process or thread processing. Each process or thread might
be given a level. Higher priority is given processor timeslice until that queue is empty, 
then lower pirority. Priority queue is really like multiple queues.

 ancestors and decedents. A common tree structure is the file system on any computer. There
 are many kinds of trees in coding such as Trees, B-Trees and Binary Trees. If you 
 get a tree such as an xml or html document the root node is returned. Trees have getChildren()
 getParent(), getSiblngs(), addChild() behavior. Might have getLeftChild() addLeftChild() 
 getRightChild() addRightChild(). A child node is a root for all of its decendents. A 
 child node might be a leaf node if it has no decendents. A child node might have removeNode()
 behavior.

like a cave system. Games and JavaFX uses a Scene Graph. In javafx it is called a graph,

 such as JSON, CSV, XML or HTML. The controller might be commmand pattern or observer pattern. In the case 
 of gui, the controller code and view code can be kept in same source file or classes. The idea is that 
 generally views may be swapped or models may be swapped without affecting the other components.

 2020-01-09 20:17:33,464 - DEBUG -  Create a base abstract factory class which will be extended to make concrete factories. Factory
has any number of createProduct()methods for making different products. These products extend a base
product. In this way products can differ depending on the concrete factory that makes them. To add a 
new line of products just build the new concrete products and concrete factory for the product line. An
example of this might be a board game with unit types and factions. Each faction would have it's own concrete
factory for getting units with faction imagry and other faction specs. Flyweight pattern uses factory design.

by window pain when needed by a factory. So you have 3 parts, a factory, a base class and a subclass for
specific types. Flyweight objects have state dependent and state independent parts. The independend parts
are used over and over or shared. I used this pattern for an RPG map composed of square tiles representing 
terrain or other objects.

switch. You can have a light, or a fan or an outlet or anything on the switch. In OO design the abstraction 
and implementation vary independently. This is like making one class and putting the behavior in a different 
class. So the interface can vary with the first class and the behavior can vary with the 2nd class.

course processing an inbox for paperwork on your desk where you always work the papers last
placed on top. This is also called LIFO or last in first out. Call stack is common application.
When you get an exception the error message wiil list a call stack trace. Called unwiding the
stack. Stack overflow is where you fill the stack up so much you run out of memory for it.

bottom of the Stack. A common example would be a keyboard Queue. As characters come in the
list builds and as your software gets time it pulls characters that first to come into the queue.
A priority queue is like the system process or thread processing. Each process or thread might
be given a level. Higher priority is given processor timeslice until that queue is empty, 
then lower pirority. Priority queue is really like multiple queues.

a node has no branches its called a leaf. Nodes are named as root, child, parent, sibling,
 ancestors and decedents. A common tree structure is the file system on any computer. There
 are many kinds of trees in coding such as Trees, B-Trees and Binary Trees. If you 
 get a tree such as an xml or html document the root node is returned. Trees have getChildren()
 getParent(), getSiblngs(), addChild() behavior. Might have getLeftChild() addLeftChild() 
 getRightChild() addRightChild(). A child node is a root for all of its decendents. A 
 child node might be a leaf node if it has no decendents. A child node might have removeNode()
 behavior.

 such as JSON, CSV, XML or HTML. The controller might be commmand pattern or observer pattern. In the case 
 of gui, the controller code and view code can be kept in same source file or classes. The idea is that 
 generally views may be swapped or models may be swapped without affecting the other components.

example of this might be a board game with unit types and factions. Each faction would have it's own concrete
factory for getting units with faction imagry and other faction specs. Flyweight pattern uses factory design.

by window pain when needed by a factory. So you have 3 parts, a factory, a base class and a subclass for
specific types. Flyweight objects have state dependent and state independent parts. The independend parts
are used over and over or shared. I used this pattern for an RPG map composed of square tiles representing 
terrain or other objects.

types of appliances to be switched on or off. You may have a pole switch, or a toggle switch or a dial 
switch. You can have a light, or a fan or an outlet or anything on the switch. In OO design the abstraction 
and implementation vary independently. This is like making one class and putting the behavior in a different 
class. So the interface can vary with the first class and the behavior can vary with the 2nd class.

A priority queue is like the system process or thread processing. Each process or thread might
be given a level. Higher priority is given processor timeslice until that queue is empty, 
then lower pirority. Priority queue is really like multiple queues.

a node has no branches its called a leaf. Nodes are named as root, child, parent, sibling,
 ancestors and decedents. A common tree structure is the file system on any computer. There
 are many kinds of trees in coding such as Trees, B-Trees and Binary Trees. If you 
 get a tree such as an xml or html document the root node is returned. Trees have getChildren()
 getParent(), getSiblngs(), addChild() behavior. Might have getLeftChild() addLeftChild() 
 getRightChild() addRightChild(). A child node is a root for all of its decendents. A 
 child node might be a leaf node if it has no decendents. A child node might have removeNode()
 behavior.

 such as JSON, CSV, XML or HTML. The controller might be commmand pattern or observer pattern. In the case 
 of gui, the controller code and view code can be kept in same source file or classes. The idea is that 
 generally views may be swapped or models may be swapped without affecting the other components.

product. In this way products can differ depending on the concrete factory that makes them. To add a 
new line of products just build the new concrete products and concrete factory for the product line. An
example of this might be a board game with unit types and factions. Each faction would have it's own concrete
factory for getting units with faction imagry and other faction specs. Flyweight pattern uses factory design.

and another for decending sort.

file types. Instead of having 100's image copies, One object holds the image and is retrieved over and over
by window pain when needed by a factory. So you have 3 parts, a factory, a base class and a subclass for
specific types. Flyweight objects have state dependent and state independent parts. The independend parts
are used over and over or shared. I used this pattern for an RPG map composed of square tiles representing 
terrain or other objects.

types of appliances to be switched on or off. You may have a pole switch, or a toggle switch or a dial 
switch. You can have a light, or a fan or an outlet or anything on the switch. In OO design the abstraction 
and implementation vary independently. This is like making one class and putting the behavior in a different 
class. So the interface can vary with the first class and the behavior can vary with the 2nd class.

List also has behavior for adding to the end of list, getting size of list, removing(index) item
from list. List may have a way to search list for object and sort list. List can add other list
and remove another list of items from the list. Vectors an list are almost the same thing. A set 
is a list with no duplicates. Can be array or LinkedList based.

placed on top. This is also called LIFO or last in first out. Call stack is common application.
When you get an exception the error message wiil list a call stack trace. Called unwiding the
stack. Stack overflow is where you fill the stack up so much you run out of memory for it.

bottom of the Stack. A common example would be a keyboard Queue. As characters come in the
list builds and as your software gets time it pulls characters that first to come into the queue.
A priority queue is like the system process or thread processing. Each process or thread might
be given a level. Higher priority is given processor timeslice until that queue is empty, 
then lower pirority. Priority queue is really like multiple queues.

a node has no branches its called a leaf. Nodes are named as root, child, parent, sibling,
 ancestors and decedents. A common tree structure is the file system on any computer. There
 are many kinds of trees in coding such as Trees, B-Trees and Binary Trees. If you 
 get a tree such as an xml or html document the root node is returned. Trees have getChildren()
 getParent(), getSiblngs(), addChild() behavior. Might have getLeftChild() addLeftChild() 
 getRightChild() addRightChild(). A child node is a root for all of its decendents. A 
 child node might be a leaf node if it has no decendents. A child node might have removeNode()
 behavior.

called this data structure a Net or Network. Examples are the power grid system,
the internet, or our highway system. Could even be three dimensional in something
like a cave system. Games and JavaFX uses a Scene Graph. In javafx it is called a graph,
but it seems to me to be more of a composition or Tree. Graphs have addVertex() removeVertex()
addEdge() removeEdge() behavior. Also getEdgeValue() getVertexValue() adjacent() neighbor() 
behavior.

 such as JSON, CSV, XML or HTML. The controller might be commmand pattern or observer pattern. In the case 
 of gui, the controller code and view code can be kept in same source file or classes. The idea is that 
 generally views may be swapped or models may be swapped without affecting the other components.

has any number of createProduct()methods for making different products. These products extend a base
product. In this way products can differ depending on the concrete factory that makes them. To add a 
new line of products just build the new concrete products and concrete factory for the product line. An
example of this might be a board game with unit types and factions. Each faction would have it's own concrete
factory for getting units with faction imagry and other faction specs. Flyweight pattern uses factory design.

by window pain when needed by a factory. So you have 3 parts, a factory, a base class and a subclass for
specific types. Flyweight objects have state dependent and state independent parts. The independend parts
are used over and over or shared. I used this pattern for an RPG map composed of square tiles representing 
terrain or other objects.

List also has behavior for adding to the end of list, getting size of list, removing(index) item
from list. List may have a way to search list for object and sort list. List can add other list
and remove another list of items from the list. Vectors an list are almost the same thing. A set 
is a list with no duplicates. Can be array or LinkedList based.

placed on top. This is also called LIFO or last in first out. Call stack is common application.
When you get an exception the error message wiil list a call stack trace. Called unwiding the
stack. Stack overflow is where you fill the stack up so much you run out of memory for it.

bottom of the Stack. A common example would be a keyboard Queue. As characters come in the
list builds and as your software gets time it pulls characters that first to come into the queue.
A priority queue is like the system process or thread processing. Each process or thread might
be given a level. Higher priority is given processor timeslice until that queue is empty, 
then lower pirority. Priority queue is really like multiple queues.

a dictionary. JavaScript arrays become a Dictionary if you use non numeric indexes. These 
may have set(key,value) or value get(key) behavior. In some languages the key is the index of
the array or list. Should be able to get list of keys or values.

a node has no branches its called a leaf. Nodes are named as root, child, parent, sibling,
 ancestors and decedents. A common tree structure is the file system on any computer. There
 are many kinds of trees in coding such as Trees, B-Trees and Binary Trees. If you 
 get a tree such as an xml or html document the root node is returned. Trees have getChildren()
 getParent(), getSiblngs(), addChild() behavior. Might have getLeftChild() addLeftChild() 
 getRightChild() addRightChild(). A child node is a root for all of its decendents. A 
 child node might be a leaf node if it has no decendents. A child node might have removeNode()
 behavior.

neighbors. In a graph any node can be a neighbor of any other node. I would have 
called this data structure a Net or Network. Examples are the power grid system,
the internet, or our highway system. Could even be three dimensional in something
like a cave system. Games and JavaFX uses a Scene Graph. In javafx it is called a graph,
but it seems to me to be more of a composition or Tree. Graphs have addVertex() removeVertex()
addEdge() removeEdge() behavior. Also getEdgeValue() getVertexValue() adjacent() neighbor() 
behavior.

 2020-01-09 20:35:56,158 - DEBUG -  Describe MVC pattern.
 2020-01-09 20:35:56,158 - DEBUG -  MVC separates Model which is the database or data files or data structures in memory from View  
and Controller. View can be the reports or gui components. A view could also be data file types
 such as JSON, CSV, XML or HTML. The controller might be commmand pattern or observer pattern. In the case 
 of gui, the controller code and view code can be kept in same source file or classes. The idea is that 
 generally views may be swapped or models may be swapped without affecting the other components.

for making classes. clone() method is also example of Prototype. This is basically making an instance object or
copy of a base class.

will make a private instance of itself the first time getInstance() is called. After that getInstance()
returns the sole instance of the class. Java Runtime class is an exaple of Singleton.

 2020-01-09 20:35:56,174 - DEBUG -  Create a base abstract factory class which will be extended to make concrete factories. Factory
has any number of createProduct()methods for making different products. These products extend a base
product. In this way products can differ depending on the concrete factory that makes them. To add a 
new line of products just build the new concrete products and concrete factory for the product line. An
example of this might be a board game with unit types and factions. Each faction would have it's own concrete
factory for getting units with faction imagry and other faction specs. Flyweight pattern uses factory design.

is used where there are many paramters for constructing an object. Can force immutability once the object is fully
created.

defined by other methods. Unlike the Interface some of the basic implementation is already coded. Template
Method uses inheritance to vary part of the algorithm.

algorithms can be supplied for one interface. Algorithms can be swapped out. An example is Java Comparable 
interface which has a compareTo(O) method. For example one implementation might be made for assending sort,
and another for decending sort.

modes in text editors. State objects are often Singltons. Another example was state of a ceiling fan, low, med
high and off. State of a vending machine, product in stock, change available, money deposited.

 2020-01-09 20:35:56,202 - DEBUG -  One to many relationship. In user interfaces this can be listeners. A component can have any
number of listeners. An object has a method to add observers. Observers have an update() method. This is 
also like callback design. In HTML with JavaScript components can have multiple observers. One example is
an auctioneer and bidders(observers). If one observer bids then the auctioneer notifies all observers of new
high bid.

item in the colleciton. The colleciton can have a method iterator() to return a fresh iterator of
itself. Generally for each or for in or for of is prefered over Iterators.

front command is called, it then calls the one it wraps. Only commands pertinent to the call at hand 
will execute. Multiple commands may execute for a given call. Real world example is coin bank that sorts coins
into stacks. Coins are sorted into stacks based on size, dime, penny, nickle, quarter, dollar.

object with one or more visit() methods. Can have more than one visitor or call accept more than once with
different visitors. Real world example is Cab Compnay, Customer and Cab Driver(Visitor) So Customer has accept(Driver)

a File. A BufferedInputStream can wrap an InputStream or a FileInputStream. Other examples of decorator can 
be seen in Views in MVC. A DoubleLineBorder might wrap a Border.

internet connection implements it. The class on client side simply calls the same methods on the
server side. The server side executes the logic and may or may not return some value to the 
client side class.  A real world example is writing a check for payment.

file types. Instead of having 100's image copies, One object holds the image and is retrieved over and over
by window pain when needed by a factory. So you have 3 parts, a factory, a base class and a subclass for
specific types. Flyweight objects have state dependent and state independent parts. The independend parts
are used over and over or shared. I used this pattern for an RPG map composed of square tiles representing 
terrain or other objects.

types of appliances to be switched on or off. You may have a pole switch, or a toggle switch or a dial 
switch. You can have a light, or a fan or an outlet or anything on the switch. In OO design the abstraction 
and implementation vary independently. This is like making one class and putting the behavior in a different 
class. So the interface can vary with the first class and the behavior can vary with the 2nd class.
