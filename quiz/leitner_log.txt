List also has behavior for adding to the end of list, getting size of list, removing(index) item
from list. List may have a way to search list for object and sort list. List can add other list
and remove another list of items from the list. Vectors an list are almost the same thing. A set 
is a list with no duplicates. Can be array or LinkedList based.

placed on top. This is also called LIFO or last in first out. Call stack is common application.
When you get an exception the error message wiil list a call stack trace. Called unwiding the
stack. Stack overflow is where you fill the stack up so much you run out of memory for it.

bottom of the Stack. A common example would be a keyboard Queue. As characters come in the
list builds and as your software gets time it pulls characters that last to come into the queue.
A priority queue is like the system process or thread processing. Each process or thread might
be given a level. Higher priority is given processor timeslice until that queue is empty, 
then lower pirority. Priority queue is really like multiple queues.

a node has no branches its called a leaf. Nodes are named as root, child, parent, sibling,
 ancestors and decedents. A common tree structure is the file system on any computer. There
 are many kinds of trees in coding such as Trees, B-Trees and Binary Trees. If you 
 get a tree such as an xml or html document the root node is returned. Trees have getChildren()
 getParent(), getSiblngs(), addChild() behavior. Might have getLeftChild() addLeftChild() 
 getRightChild() addRightChild(). A child node is a root for all of its decendents. A 
 child node might be a leaf node if it has no decendents. A child node might have removeNode()
 behavior.

the internet, or our highway system. Could even be three dimensional in something
like a cave system. Games and JavaFX uses a Scene Graph. In javafx it is called a graph,
but it seems to me to be more of a composition or Tree. Graphs have addVertex() removeVertex()
addEdge() removeEdge() behavior. Also getEdgeValue() getVertexValue() adjacent() neighbor() 
behavior.

 such as JSON, CSV, XML or HTML. The controller might be commmand pattern or observer pattern. In the case 
 of gui, the controller code and view code can be kept in same source file or classes. The idea is that 
 generally views may be swapped or models may be swapped without affecting the other components.

has any number of createProduct()methods for making different products. These products extend a base
product. In this way products can differ depending on the concrete factory that makes them. To add a 
new line of products just build the new concrete products and concrete factory for the product line. An
example of this might be a board game with unit types and factions. Each faction would have it's own concrete
factory for getting units with faction imagry and other faction specs. Flyweight pattern uses factory design.

file types. Instead of having 100's image copies, One object holds the image and is retrieved over and over
by window pain when needed by a factory. So you have 3 parts, a factory, a base class and a subclass for
specific types. Flyweight objects have state dependent and state independent parts. The independend parts
are used over and over or shared. I used this pattern for an RPG map composed of square tiles representing 
terrain or other objects.

types of appliances to be switched on or off. You may have a pole switch, or a toggle switch or a dial 
switch. You can have a light, or a fan or an outlet or anything on the switch. In OO design the abstraction 
and implementation vary independently. This is like making one class and putting the behavior in a different 
class. So the interface can vary with the first class and the behavior can vary with the 2nd class.
